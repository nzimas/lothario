Lothario is a mischievous quadraphonic expansion of Carter’s Delay for norns (https://github.com/williamthazard/carters-delay-norns). 

It keeps the original’s hands-on, granular delay workflow intact, but injects controlled chaos into every reflection. 
Each playback grain can be randomly transformed with pitch-shifting, ring modulation, sample-rate reduction, or bit-crushing—applied per reflection, not globally.

A simple FX probability control decides how often these mutations occur, while dedicated min/max range parameters let you shape how subtle or extreme they can be. Set it tame for gentle color, or push it wild for fractured, unstable echoes.

In short: Carter’s Delay, but flirtier—faithful at its core, unpredictable at the edges.

##Notes

A class-compliant USB audio interface with at least 4 outputs is required.
Lothario was developed specifically for the Behringer UMC404HD, arguably the cheapest 4-output device of its kind that money can buy.
I have developed a mod that greatly simplifies the setup of this particular model.
