Lothario is a mischievous expansion of Carter’s Delay for norns. It keeps the original’s hands-on, musical delay workflow intact, but injects controlled chaos into every reflection. Each playback grain can be randomly transformed with pitch-shifting, ring modulation, sample-rate reduction, or bit-crushing—applied per reflection, not globally.

A simple FX probability control decides how often these mutations occur, while dedicated min/max range parameters let you shape how subtle or extreme they can be. Set it tame for gentle color, or push it wild for fractured, unstable echoes. Crucially, Lothario stays silent when there’s no input, only reacting to real sound.

In short: Carter’s Delay, but flirtier—faithful at its core, unpredictable at the edges.
